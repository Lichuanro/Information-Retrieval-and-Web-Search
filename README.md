# Information Retrieval and Web Search

This is my implementation of [CS 276](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/) homework.

pa1 is for **Index Construction**

Including uncompressed and compressed index, boolean conjunctive queries. 

It simulates the real world index construction when memory resources are limited by partitioning data into multiple folders(blocks)

(I'm still working on pa2 and pa3)
