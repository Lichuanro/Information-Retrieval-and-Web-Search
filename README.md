# Information Retrieval and Web Search

This is my implementation of [CS 276](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/) homework.

pa1 is for **Index Construction**, including uncompressed and compressed index, boolean conjunctive queries. It simulates the real world index construction when memory resources are limited by partitioning data into multiple folders(blocks)

pa2 is about **Spelling Correction**, including Candidate Generator and Candidate Scorer.

pa3 is about webpage **ranking**, with implementation of different ranking functions.
